This project was a proof-of-concept for an effective key logger with remote data access that can run on modern Windows (7, 8, 10) in plain sight limited user permissions.
The keylogger itself is written in C++, there is a optional code injector program that can merge the keylogger payload into other executables, and that injector is written in C++ and x86 ASM.
The backend server is written in PHP and uses mySQL for storage.

I accept no liability for any use of the code. This code is only a proof-of-concept and is not intended to be used for any illegal activities.
