SNSOS was a small project undertaken to learn more about the x86/amd64 architecture at the OS / system level, but mostly just for fun. I was working on this in 2008.

Parts that were finished and functional include the x64 protected mode boot loader that supported GUID partition tables, and preliminary work on a micro-kernel with basic IO and memory management.
