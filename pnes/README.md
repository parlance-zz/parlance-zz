PNES is a partially functional Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. This was a project for an advanced placement CTS class in highschool, written in BlitzPlus (a BASIC variant). At the time of development (2002-2003) documentation for the NES hardware was not as accessible or complete as it is today.

The code features 6502 CPU core emulation, basic PPU emulation, and support for only the default memory mapper. The emulator was capable of loading and displaying the titlescreen for The Legend of Zelda as well as playing a small collection of homebrew demos and ROMs.
