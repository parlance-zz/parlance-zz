This is an unfinished clone of Quake 3 game engine (before the source was public) on (original) Xbox with BSP and MD3 rendering, and a native Xbox shader compiler from Q3 materials.
To run or even compile this code today you would need a dev Xbox and the XDK software, neither of which are readily available.
