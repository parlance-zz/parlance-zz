This is an unfinished clone of Quake 3 game engine (before the source was public) on (original) Xbox with BSP and MD3 rendering, and a native Xbox shader compiler from Q3 materials.
To run or even compile this code today you would need a dev Xbox and the XDK software, neither of which are readily available. 

This work was largely completed within class time constraints for an advanced placement CTS class in my senior year of highschool (2003-2004).

I'm fairly certain I left this in a broken state, but with no way to build it I have no way to check.
